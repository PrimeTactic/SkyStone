Ok so for reference the motor is named TestMotor
the servo is named TestServo
and the ColorSensor is named TestColor
the webcam is named just webcam
so just create any test classes you want here, I will leave you with a hardware diagnostic
as well as a basic vision pipeline and our vision pipeline.
The basic one will just display whatever the webcam sees and the other one is the one I have
in the comp folder with the Mats summation that I am hoping you can work on
Other than that good luck! We can discuss this all on friday.
